	If your computer can handle it, you can use the handy uploader below to upload your pictures. If you don't see the tool, then you don't have Java installed, and you'll have to use the upload buttons above.<br><br>
	You can resize your pictures when you upload, if you only want small pictures. These upload much faster than large pictures, but are not useful as high resolution files for clients.<br>
	<br>
	
	NOTE: When you <B>Add files</b>, below, you can choose more than one file at a time! I strongly suggested you upload no more than 10 pictures at a time, since making thumbnails is slow and the Internet can get blocked at any time.
