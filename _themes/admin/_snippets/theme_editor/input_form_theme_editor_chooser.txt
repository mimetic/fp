					Names with an asterisk (*) are user-created themes. Names without an asterisk are system themes and cannot be deleted.

				<p>
					When you edit and save a system theme, you are really creating a new "user-created" theme. The new theme takes the place of the system theme with the same name. You can edit a theme, then save with a new name which will not cover up a system theme.
				</p>
				<p>
					When you delete a theme which has the same name as a system them, the system theme will reappear.
