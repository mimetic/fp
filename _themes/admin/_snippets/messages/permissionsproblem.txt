			<small>I can't process {filename}. The <i>permissions</i> settings on this file don't allow me to work with
			it, even though I can see it!<BR>
			
			Here's what you need to do if you're using Fetch on a Macintosh computer :
			<ul>
			<li>Select the file in Fetch (click one time only on the file name !)</li>
			<li>in the Remote menu, choose Set Permissions</li>
			<li>Check ALL the boxes and click 'OK'</li>
			<li>Reload this page, and I'll try to get it again.</li>
			</ul>
			When you upload a file with FTP, your software sets the <i>permissions</i> of the file.
			If the settings don't allow "anyone" to read and write the file, then the system
			can't work with it.
