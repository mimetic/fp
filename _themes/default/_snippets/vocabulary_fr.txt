// Vocabulary Replacement for the FP system
// First word is the word to be replaced. It must be coded in your text like this:
//   {fp:mykeyword}
// Either "fp" or "FP" will work. 
// If no replacement is found in the list, the original term is used with the {fp:} part removed.
// Each theme can have its own list!
// This list is comma separated (comma between terms, each set on a new line)

// NOTE: For *English* vocabulary, words are replaced starting from the top of this list.
// You can have terms that include other terms, if the order is correct!
// See the "Basic" terms at the bottom of the page.
