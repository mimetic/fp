// This file allows a deletion in one table to
// make deletions in others. So, if deleting a Project
// means related entries in the Parts database should go,
// this is describe here.
// 
// Each line is a command, actually. If we do a "CascadeDelete ("{PROJECTS}", $ID)
// then each line, here, which is a {PROJECTS} line, will be executed by
// mysql.
// 
// This table is a list of dependencies of the databases
// Each line is executed for a given commmand and table
// Note, to delete a row, not only are dependent tables listed
// but the main table, too.
// $ID and $table are replaced in the 'where' part with the main table's ID 
// and the name of the main table.

// If there's no entry for a table, it's assumed nothing
// special has to be done with that table, and edit/delete/insert
// happen without considering other tables.
